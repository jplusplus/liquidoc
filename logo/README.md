Build notes
-----------

The original logo was drawn in the development version of Inkscape, which features the Fillet+Chamfer path effect,
an extremely handy way to tune rounded corners.

There is also a rendered copy of the path on the bottom of the SVG file if you can't run this version.


Fonts
-----

The logo font is [Gidole](https://github.com/larsenwork/Gidole), using its sister font Gidolinya for the capital L.
